# BRC-45: Definition of UTXOs as Bitcoin Tokens

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

Abstract:
---------

This document proposes an examination of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) as the central framework of tokenization in Bitcoin, justifying their usage based on their inherent simplicity, efficiency, and secure transfer processes. Through UTXOs, Bitcoin allows the delineation of rules governing the transfer of valuable tokens via scripting. In contrast to alternative tokenization proposals, UTXOs render the need for comprehensive, trusted indexing and chain scanning systems obsolete. Instead, transaction parties require only to validate transactions pertinent to them, employing miners to mitigate double-spend attempts, thus achieving tokenization of assets at scale.

Background:
-----------

**Tokenization**, in the realm of digital assets, represents the process of substituting valuable, real-world assets with digital tokens on a blockchain. Within the context of Bitcoin, tokenization predominantly revolves around Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs).

**Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)** are remnants of Bitcoin transactions yet to be spent or used as inputs for newer transactions. Each UTXO in Bitcoin can be seen as a distinct token. Unlike other tokenization methods, UTXOs are directly transferred from sender to recipient, the legitimacy of which can be independently verified, thus significantly reducing computational and time complexities.

**Scripts** in Bitcoin define the conditions under which UTXOs can be spent. These conditions form the essence of token transfer rules, ensuring secure transactions of digital tokens.

**Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)** is a method used in Bitcoin for lightweight clients to verify transactions without requiring the entire blockchain's download. The [BRC-9](../transactions/0009.md) process for SPV enables recipients to verify transfers quickly.

Argument: Benefits of UTXOs as the Fundamental Unit of Tokenization:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

UTXOs offer a unique advantage as the foundational unit of tokenization in Bitcoin due to their inherent characteristics and the robustness they bring to the transaction system:

1.  Decentralization and Trust Minimization: With UTXOs, parties need only to validate transactions that concern them, eliminating the necessity for a trusted intermediary to index and scan every transaction on the blockchain. This process enhances the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and minimizes trust requirements.

2.  Scalability: By treating UTXOs as the base unit of tokenization, we can facilitate efficient asset tokenization at scale. With direct transfers, the UTXO model bypasses complex indexing systems, thus reducing computational overhead and increasing transaction speed.

3.  Double-Spend Protection: Miners play an integral role in UTXO transactions by preventing double-spending. As each UTXO can only be spent once, miners verify and confirm that no UTXO is duplicated or spent twice, preserving the security of the blockchain.

4.  Simplified Verification: The [BRC-9](../transactions/0009.md) process for SPV enables easy verification of transfers without needing the full blockchain data. In UTXO-based transactions, the recipient can independently validate the transaction, making it efficient and user-friendly.

In summary, the UTXO model provides an efficient and scalable framework for tokenization in Bitcoin, while upholding the principles of decentralization and trust minimization. Its distinctive attributes such as direct transfer, double-spend prevention, and simplified verification lend themselves to a secure and streamlined tokenization process, validating the assertion that UTXOs are the fundamental unit of tokenization in Bitcoin.
