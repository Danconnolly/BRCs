# BRC-2: Data Encryption and Decryption

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

We devise a method for applications to request the encryption and decryption of data. Specifically, we define a mechanism for data encryption within the BRC-42 key derivation system, utilizing the BRC-43 protocol and key ID scheme. During encryption, the sender derives their own child private key and the child public key of the recipient using the BRC-42 process, then computes an ECDH shared secret between the child keys which is used in symmetric encryption with AES-256-GCM. The initialization vector, together with the ciphertext, are sent to the recipient. During decryption, the recipient computes their own private key and the public key of the sender, and uses ECDH to compute the same shared secret. The key is then used together with the provided initialization vector to decrypt the ciphertext. When no counterparty exists, we stipulate substitution for the sender's own public key in the child key derivation process.

## Motivation

There is a demonstrated<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> desire within the Bitcoin ecosystem for wallets to support the encryption of data between parties. Facilitating the secure exchange of encrypted data enables improved user privacy and new kinds of applications that are only possible when their users can communicate directly and securely. Other encryption systems have been developed and integrated into various platforms, but no standard architecture exists that supports both single-party and multi-party encryption, intelligent protocol-level permissions management within applications, and leverages BRC-42 key derivation.

## Specification

We start with the same constructs defined in BRC-43: users with clients, protocols and applications. We stipulate the use of BRC-43 invoice numbers in the context of BRC-42 key derivation, and we build on top of the permissions architecture defined by BRC-43.

When an application sends a message to a client requesting that data be encrypted, the message comprises:
- The BRC-43 security level, protocol ID, key ID and counterparty to facilitate BRC-42 key derivation and permissioning
- The data to encrypt

We stipulate the following process for encryption:
- The message sender derives a child public key for the recipient
- The message sender derives their own child private key
- The message sender computes the ECDH shared secret between the two keys
- The resulting elliptic curve point's X and Y values are hashed with SHA256
- The resulting 256-bit value is used in conjunction with a randomly-generated 256-bit initialization vector to encrypt the message with AES-256-GCM
- The initialization vector is prepended to the ciphrtext, and the combined value is returned by the client to the application over the abstract BRC-1 communications substrate.

We stipulate the reverse of this process for decryption, and the existence of an inverse mechanism for an application to request decryption of ciphertext by the client over the BRC-1 abstract substrate.
