## Specification

Compound Path

| Field                     | Description                                                                        |        Size          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| nIndices                  | VarInt number of paths contained within                                            | 1-9 bytes            |
||
| index                     | VarInt index of path included                                                      | 1-9 bytes x nIndices |
| **repeat x nIndices** |
| nLeaves                   | VarInt number of leaves which follow in the path                                   | 1-9 bytes            |
||
| leaf                      | Each leaf is a 32 byte hash                                                        | 32 bytes             |
| path mask                 | One byte as the exponent of a 2^N mask for path inclusion                          | 1 byte               |
| **repeat x nLeaves** |


### Example

```javascript
version
00000000BEEF
nPaths // paths first
index
nLeaves
leaves... // repeat for each path
```
