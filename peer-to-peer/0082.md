# BRC-82: Defining a Scalable IPv6 Multicast Protocol for Blockchain Transaction Broadcast and Update Delivery

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

This document builds upon the insights of [BRC-80](../opinions/0080.md) and proposes a scalable, efficient IPv6 multicast protocol specifically designed for the broadcast of blockchain transactions and the delivery of transaction status updates, such as merkle proofs and double-spend attempt notifications. Recognizing the limitations of existing IPv6 multicast protocols, including Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), this protocol addresses the needs for massive scalability, efficient data delivery, and economic sustainability required by modern blockchain networks. This protocol employs a layered approach using MLDv2 at the edges, multicast Border Gateway Protocol (mBGP) at the core, and introduces an intermediate aggregation/summarization layer to ensure global scalability and efficiency.

This document is intended for network engineers and architects familiar with IPv6 and multicast technologies but may not have extensive knowledge of blockchain technology. The technical details provided aim to bridge the knowledge gap and foster understanding of the specific network demands and solutions in blockchain operations.

## 1. Introduction

With the increasing volume of transactions in blockchain networks and the need for rapid propagation, traditional methods of transaction broadcast and update delivery are becoming inadequate. MLD, as noted in BRC-80, provides mechanisms for IPv6 hosts to report interest in multicast groups, but does not scale to the needs of global blockchain operations, which involve potentially trillions of multicast groups.

## 2. Multicast Protocol Components

### 2.1 MLDv2 at the Edges

MLDv2 allows IPv6 nodes to report not only their interest in specific multicast groups but also to specify interest in blocks of addresses. This capability is crucial for managing the high volume of multicast groups involved in blockchain networks.

- **Local Router Management**: Routers at the network edge use MLDv2 to manage local subscriptions efficiently, dynamically handling group memberships as user interests change.

### 2.2 mBGP at the Core

mBGP manages the exchange of multicast routing information between autonomous systems, crucial for the global delivery of multicast traffic.

- **Global Traffic Routing**: mBGP ensures that multicast traffic is routed efficiently across different ISPs and backbone networks, based on aggregated routing information that represents the interests of multiple local networks.

### 2.3 Aggregation/Summarization Layer

An intermediate layer that aggregates multicast interests into larger, more manageable groups significantly reduces the complexity and volume of routing information needed at the global level.

- **Regional Aggregation**: Dedicated multicast routers or servers summarize the multicast group information from multiple local networks, reducing the granularity of information propagated globally.

## 3. Protocol Operation

### 3.1 Subscription and Broadcasting

Nodes subscribe to multicast groups relevant to their interests via MLDv2, which informs local routers of these interests. When transactions are broadcast or updates are sent, they are addressed to specific multicast groups based on transaction attributes such as version numbers and portions of transaction IDs.

### 3.2 Routing and Delivery

- **Local Handling**: Local routers manage multicast traffic within their networks based on MLDv2 reports.
- **Global Distribution**: mBGP is used by ISPs to route traffic globally based on summarized interests from the aggregation layer.
- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The aggregation/summarization layer updates mBGP information periodically, balancing the need for real-time accuracy with global routing efficiency.

## 4. Economic Incentives and Security

To ensure the economic sustainability of this multicast architecture, a mechanism for out-of-band payments must be implemented alongside these lower-level routing protocols, allowing nodes to compensate network providers for the data they consume. This payment mechanism should be designed to prevent DoS attacks by making it costly to spam the network with unnecessary subscriptions. MLDv2 subscriptions or mBGP advertisements made without respect to an associated payment must be ignored and dropped.

- **Payment Integration**: Implement a secure, blockchain-based payment system for subscription services to ensure that providers of network resources are compensated for their services. This is an area of future work.

## 5. Implementation Considerations

- **Security Measures**: Implement robust security measures to authenticate and authorize multicast subscriptions to prevent unauthorized and costly subscriptions that have not been paid for.
- **Monitoring and Management**: Deploy real-time monitoring tools to manage multicast traffic flows and performance across all layers of the network.

## 6. Future Directions and Research

Further research is needed to refine the aggregation algorithms and to enhance the scalability of the mBGP routing updates. Additionally, exploring the integration of an out-of-band payment mechanism for these multicast communications at scale will be crucial.

## 7. Conclusion

The proposed protocol provides a comprehensive solution for the scalable and efficient distribution of blockchain transaction data across global networks using IPv6 multicast. By leveraging MLDv2 at the edges for dynamic subscription management, mBGP at the core for robust global routing, and an aggregation/summarization layer in between, this protocol addresses the unique challenges posed by the high data volumes and rapid dynamics of modern blockchain networks.

This document serves as a foundational step towards implementing a robust multicast protocol tailored for blockchain applications, ensuring efficient data dissemination and economic viability.
