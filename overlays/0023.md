# BRC-23: Confederacy Host Interconnect Protocol (CHIP)

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

We outline the Confederacy Host Interconnect Protocol (CHIP), a peer discovery mechanism for UTXO-based overlay networks. CHIP is an overlay network which tracks active network operators hosting specific topics, facilitating UTXO discovery, providing robust availability guarantees, and enabling fault tolerance. This document specifies the format for CHIP tokens, their propagation across the network, and the process of using them to find and connect with hosts.

## Motivation

The [BRC-22](./0022.md) standard defines a method for running a server that accepts transactions, admits their outputs into topics, and tracks topical UTXO sets. However, there is a need for a connectivity and peer discovery mechanism for users who want to stay loosely in sync with one another. CHIP addresses this need, ensuring efficient synchronization and data propagation by facilitating the discovery of network operators actively hosting specific topics.

## Specification

We define the various components of the Confederacy host interconnect architecture.

### CHIP Token Format

CHIP tokens are registered on the Bitcoin SV blockchain as single-satoshi BRC-48 outputs representing hosting advertisements by Confederacy network operators. The token fields are ordered as follows:

- ield 1: The string "CHIP", denoting a CHIP advertisement.
- Field 2: The BRC-31 identity key of the advertiser creating the token.
- Field 3: The internet domain name of the HTTPS server hosting the network node.
- Field 4: The topic name hosted by the advertiser.

### Token Creation and Submission

The advertiser creates a transaction output containing the token and submits it to known nodes, including their own. The BRC-48 locking key must be linked to the advertiser's BRC-31 identity key using the BRC-42 and BRC-43 methodologies.

### Token Validation and Admission

Nodes accepting CHIP tokens must validate the identity key's link to the signature-producing key before admitting the output. Invalid tokens must be rejected.

### CHIP Lookup Service

A standardized BRC-24 provider named "CHIP" is defined for querying CHIP advertisement UTXOs using "topic" and "advertiser" keys in an AND stipulation.

## Implementation

To implement BRC-23, follow these steps:

1. Define the CHIP token format as per the Specification section.
2. Implement token creation and submission based on the defined format and key derivation methodologies.
3. Develop a mechanism for token validation and admission at the node level.
4. Implement the CHIP lookup service using the BRC-24 provider and query object.

The BRC-23 standard outlines the Confederacy Host Interconnect Protocol (CHIP), a critical addition to the BRC-22 architecture for facilitating efficient UTXO discovery and providing robust availability guarantees. By following the specifications outlined in this document, the Bitcoin SV ecosystem will benefit from enhanced connectivity and fault tolerance in UTXO-based overlay networks.
