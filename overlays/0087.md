# BRC-87: Standardized Naming Conventions for BRC-22 Topic Managers and BRC-24 Lookup Services

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

This document proposes standardized naming conventions for topic managers in BRC-22 and lookup services in BRC-24 to ensure clarity, interoperability, and uniformity across different implementations. The goal is to provide consistent and easily understandable names that facilitate efficient communication and integration between overlay network nodes and services within the BSV ecosystem.

## Motivation

Currently, there is no unified naming convention for topic managers and lookup services utilized in BRC-22 and BRC-24 standards. This absence can lead to confusion and errors in integration.

## Specification

### Naming Consistency Across Nodes

Network services that deal with the same transactions and protocols should negotiate to agree upon a common name for their topic managers and lookup services. This ensures resiliency, in that network users are able to access the same services at known locations across nodes, even if one node in an overlay network goes down. It also aids node operators in synchronizing relevant transactions with one another.

### General Guidelines

1.  **Consistency**: Names should be consistent across different implementations to avoid ambiguity.
2.  **Clarity**: Names should be clear and descriptive enough for developers to understand their purpose.
3.  **Length**: While names should be descriptive, they should also be concise to ensure ease of use in configurations and codebases.

### Master Rules

1. Only lower-case letters and underscores.
2. Must not start or end with an underscore.
3. No consecutive underscores.
4. No longer than 50 characters.

### Naming Conventions for BRC-22 Topic Managers

1.  **Prefix**: Use the prefix `tm_` to indicate a topic manager.
2.  **Topic Identifier**: Follow the prefix with a short descriptor of the topic.
3.  **Example**:
    -   `tm_uhrp_files`
    -   `tm_tempo_songs`

### Naming Conventions for BRC-24 Lookup Services

1.  **Prefix**: Use the prefix `ls_` to denote a lookup service.
2.  **Service Identifier**: Follow the prefix with a brief descriptor of the lookup service functionality.
3.  **Example**:
    -   `ls_uhrp_files`
    -   `ls_tempo_songs_search`

## Implementation

Each overlay network node and service provider must update their naming conventions to comply with the standardized guidelines described in this document. This update involves renaming existing topic managers and lookup services accordingly and ensuring that new implementations follow these standardized conventions.

By standardizing naming conventions for topic managers and lookup services, we can significantly enhance the clarity, consistency, and interoperability of overlay networks on the BSV blockchain.
